## Project Description

**Business Problem:**
Whilst there are many solutions out there tackling mental health directly, we would like to provide an approach towards documenting details which one is thankful for. The goal of this application is to make oneself explore all the different things that could make them happy, which can indirectly boost one's happiness. Unfortunately, documenting on paper can be quite inconvenient and cumbersome, in addition to being very difficult to check for duplicate entries.

**Competitors:**

**Description:**
Our application will allow a user to track their happiness, and enter bullet points of what they were happy for. However, the user must not be able to input similar items which made them happy, as this is how the application encourages the user to explore for new things in their life that make them happy. We want our application to be platform-independent (will support **mobile & desktop**), which is why we are building this on the **web**. The application will have dashboards, reminders, and suggestions to aid them with exploring their happiness. Moreover, our application will use **sentiment analysis** in order to gather data on their happiness, in correlation to the user's input. Furthermore, our application will also use **topic modeling** in order to discourage repeated similar entries, so the user can really explore things that make them happy.

**Technical Aspects**
 - Machine Learning: Topic Modeling & Sentiment Analysis 
 - Responsive & Accessible Front-End
 - Scalable Backend 
 - Cloud Deployment 
 - Automated Testing 
 - Cloud Implementation
 - UI/UX Design
